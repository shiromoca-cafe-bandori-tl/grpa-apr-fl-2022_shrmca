A copy of Garupa's 2022 April Fools' VN, which is (or was, depending on when you read this) hosted here: https://april-bang-dream.bushimo.jp/

As mentioned in the game's main screen, the game is built on the Artemis engine - thus, one can unpack and pack the resources using your VN resource editor of choice.

My current plan for translating this, if I do tackle this, is to repack the translated files using QuickBMS (https://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm), using the Artemis repacker as provided by the same. As I do, you'll be able to view the results in the page attached to this repo, https://shiromoca-cafe-bandori-tl.github.io/grpa-apr-fl-2022_shrmca/.

If you want to read my TL but rather not trust QuickBMS (which is reasonable) you should be able to take the modified script files within the `./script` folder and repack them into the `artemis.data` file using a repacker you trust.
